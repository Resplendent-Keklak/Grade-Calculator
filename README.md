Grade Calculator (name to be changed depending upon whether or not people think it's too generic or it's a copyrighted term and I just haven't checked...because I didn't bother to) is intended to help calculate the total point value, percentage grade value, GPA, and other forms of any student's grade (per subject or term). Using this program may require a user to open a C++ interpreter depending upon how much effort I have currently put into exporting this into an executable, but I hope to find a way to make this into an installable application and/or part of a dynamic, public website if I cease being lazy and just get out of bed earlier than noon every day. Anyway, enjoy the incomplete grade calculator!

## Overview
*This section is a work in progress. Come back soon for more!*
So basically...
- Program size: TBA
- Runs like: DOESN'T RUN
### Current Functionality
None!
### Roadmap
#### Features in Scope
This part is boring and subject to lots of change; scroll beyond these checklists for the stuff that pertains to most viewers.
- [ ] First welcome message
- [ ] "Keystroke as input" feature
- [ ] General end user instructions module
- [ ] "Calculate subject grade" loop
- [ ] "Calculate term GPA" loop
- [ ] End user can name current subject/term
- [ ] Add user input phase to calculator loop
- [ ] Add input verification phase to calculator loop (users cannot input negative or irrelevant scores unless they are predefined sentinel values)
- [ ] Undo feature and back keystroke feature and make them DIFFERENT keys by default
- [ ] Add basic calculation results phase to calculator loop; will be fixed/expanded in later checklist item
- [ ] GPA settings to customize GPA type based on numbers/letters and range
- [ ] Subject grade settings to customize based on whether or not a point system, percentage, or other raw grade form is used
- [ ] Subject grade settings for what range is considered what letter (e.g. F-, C, A+)
- [ ] Subject grade settings for what is needed to pass and/or go on to future dependent courses
- [ ] Subject grade assignment type weight-for-grade settings
- [ ] Subject grade extra credit assignment settings
- [ ] Ask end user for autofail conditions (e.g. missing attendance, multiple incomplete classwork, final exam failure)
- [ ] Ask end user if their institution demands them to receive tutoring if they fail a specific assignment, and remind them if they enter a failed assignment of that type
- [ ] Ask end user what assignment types they'd receive late credit for and at what grade depreciation rate
- [ ] Ask end user for grade rounding conditions (floor, ceiling, .5%-rounds-up, or custom)
- [ ] Ask end user if their grade will be curved and how it will be curved
- [ ] Ask end user if they are allowed to be "excused" for an assignment and what it means for their grade
- [ ] Improve calculator loop based on user settings
- [ ] Option to check their subject and GPA grades with a detailed breakdown view
#### Features Mildly Out of Scope (for Winter Break)
- [ ] Accessibility setting to allow end user to customize keystrokes/binds
- [ ] Name and add data to multiple subjects
- [ ] Link subject data to term data between calculator types
- [ ] Allow end user to select target grade per subject/term and tell them to study more/take care of themselves better if they aren't meeting target
- [ ] Save progress as app/site data to some file format (.txt I GUESS \*throws hands in air\*)\
#### Features VERY Out of Scope (Also Just for Winter Break)
- [ ] Make basic-looking front end in lieu of possibly moving out this project
- [ ] Put program in a public domain
- [ ] POSSIBLY make this an executable file thingy
- [ ] Add an autism diagnostic test that will give end user a score of how likely they fall under the autism spectrum for having decided to even use this product (I'm autistic too it's okay I'm not being ableist I swear--\*gets slapped\*)
### Built With
#### Programming
- C++
- C (still to be decided if this is necessary)
#### Environments
IDK yet probably something from JetBrains because I learned I don't like VSCode that much :/
#### Front-End (!!!PENDING!!!)
- CSS (*ONLY* if I have time/energy)
- HTML (repeat note above)

## Acknowledgements
Thank you all in the NJIT Class of 2027 Snapchat community for being so patient with me and my lack of drops after my initial proposal post. Also, thank you to the Computer Science department of NJIT for providing CS 115: Introduction to Computer Science in C++, for helping me re-learn the basics of this language after a long time of having not done anything with it. Most importantly, I must thank AKROSI8, for loving me and supporting me so I could be able to script (and not oversleep) during the 2023-2024 winter break XOXOXOXOXOXOXO <3 <3 <3.

I DO NOT THANK GITHUB COPILOT. YOU HELPED NADA!

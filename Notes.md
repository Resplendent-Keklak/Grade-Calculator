## Grading Conditions
### Types of Grades
#### Non-GPA Style
Non-GPA style grades tend to be defined by the department that runs the student's provided course or the teachers themselves.
- **Points-based:** a "raw grade format." Each assignment or type of assignment yields points, which are totaled up to hopefully meet an amount needed to pass or earn a good letter grade
- **Percent-based:** a "raw grade format." Each assignment or type of assignment is graded based on percent completion/accuracy; this is the most easy type to curve
- **Letter grade:** a "derived grade format." Depending upon how well a student fares after doing an assignment, assignment type, or entire subject, the student scores a letter and possibly a "plus, flat, or minus" modifier to that letter.

#### GPA Style
GPA style grades tend to be determined by a student's institution and usually only stand in as the standard grading style for each subject, term, and cumulative grade.
- **Numeric GPA:** the most common kind of GPA that usually starts at 0 or 1 for a failing grade, 4 to 5 for a perfect grade, and something in the middle for a satisfactory grade. It is usually derived, meaning it depends upon a raw grade format like points-based grading or percentage-based grading
- **Percent-based:** a GPA style that simply takes the subject's percent completion/accuracy grade (if it exists) and turns it directly into the certified GPA for the subject
- OTHERS?
### Curving
Teachers, departments, or institutions may choose to curve, or artificially alter, a student or class's grades. Single assignments, whole types of assignments, and final grades for a subject can all be curved, but usually whole term GPA and cumulative GPA cannot be curved. Curves can positively or negatively affect a student's grade/GPA, and usually they 
- **Everyone gets a bonus:** in an effort to make a teacher pass more students, they may choose to curve everyone up a static or varied value (if varied, less additional points are awarded to people with better grades while more additional points are awarded to people with worse grades)
- **Binomial curve:** grades increase/decrease for people with already poor grades, and grades decrease/increase for people with already good grades.
- **Reverse curve:** exceptionally angry teachers can reduce the grade of any student by a static or varied value depending upon what grade the student already has

There are many other forms of curving that exist, and I will update this list when I do a whole lot more research.
### Extra Credit
Teachers and departments may offer extra credit for whole classes. Sometimes, teachers may offer extra credit assignments to certain students specifically, usually those who are not doing well in that class. Types of extra credit may include...
- **Additional assignments:** teachers may award students additional points, drop bad grades, or otherwise do something to benefit a student's grade if they complete an additional assignment. Usually, these assignments are far more difficult than that of regular coursework.
- **Built-in extra credit:** teachers may award a 100% for a graded-for-accuracy assignment if students get a number of parts less than the total amount of available parts to the assignment. Usually, this form of extra credit exists for quizzes, tests, and exams.
- **Random dares:** teachers may award points or pass every student one or a few assignments if one or more students fulfill a dare.
- **Sexual favors:** while highly unethical and often worthy of getting a teacher fired and any students expelled, a student may offer their body or convince close friends/family to offer their own towards a teacher or department manager to help them get a better grade in their course.

### Special Grade Conditions
- **Excused:** depending upon what exactly it does to a student's grade, it "shouldn't display a zero, therefore it shouldn't affect your grade." Excusing an assignment may cause the average for the grade to simply require less assignments to determine the average (how many assignments were excused were how many assignments were not included in the average).
- **Late:** depending upon the assignment type, completing an assignment late may yield partial to no credit. Late assignments done near the end of the term usually cannot yield any credit. The proportion of credit a student may receive for completing an assignment late within the interval in which they may receive credit tends to depreciate each hour or day.
- **Incomplete:** this type usually applies to whole courses, and it's only given out under very specific instances when a student would normally finish their course but cannot due to getting extremely sick in the middle of the term, suffering a severe mental health condition that starts while the term is in progress, etc.

## Branding
### Name Change?
- Something that isn't too forgettable
- Don't be self-aggrandizing and tack on "Keklak's" to the title
- Don't use "NJIT" in the name unless approved by institution
- If I choose a target audience (college, high schoolers, etc.) I could prepend "Grade Calculator" with "College," "University," "Postsecondary," "Secondary," "High School," etc.
### Icon for Executable/Site Favicon?
Got no fully-drawn ideas for this part so far, but I think the following ideas, if meshed together, might work:
- cartoonized report card with circled grade
- cartoonized calculator with "= A+" or something in the display
- circled grade alone?
- NOT BLUE because all forms of blue are too basic/common of a main color scheme choice and frankly people are aging out of the blue app icon aesthetic
- Avoid NJIT branding unless approved by institution
